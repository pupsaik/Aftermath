**Aftermath** is a small homemade post-apocalyptic game created as an assignment for the *Software Modeling and Analysis* course.  
Every single asset was hand-drawn by me.

## 🎮 About the Game

This is a 2D pixel game set in a world after a global catastrophe.  
The player explores the environment, avoids dangers, and interacts with objects to survive.

> ⚠️ You might notice some redundant design patterns in the code.  
> These were intentionally added as part of the assignment requirements — to include patterns even where they aren’t nessesarily needed... Yeah...
